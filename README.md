The code sample is executable with the link above thanks to github pages! :)

Three.js adaptor to fetch chemicals based on the name and display them on the screen

This is a basic example of fetching from the PubChem databank of compounds in a search field style fasion. It is as simple as I could get with the Three.js library. I derrived the rendering code from the Three.js css3D rendering examples.


Please ask any questions and I can try to answer them but I am very busy at the moment so forgive the delay!
